## 🚦 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Xcode:** Download the latest version from the Mac App Store.
*   **Apple Developer Account:** Required to install the app on a physical device.
*   **Firebase Account:** To enable Firebase-dependent features (Authentication, Firestore), you'll need to set up your own Firebase project and add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
*   **API Keys for AI and Vitals Monitoring:**
    *   The app uses Google Generative AI (Gemini) for its AI features and ThingSpeak for neonatal patch vitals. You will need to obtain API keys for these services.
    1.  Navigate to the `MaaKosh/Core/` directory.
    2.  You'll find a file named `APIKeys.swift.example`.
    3.  **Duplicate this file and rename the copy to `APIKeys.swift`**.
    4.  Open `APIKeys.swift` and replace the placeholder strings with your actual API keys:
        *   `geminiAPIKey`: Your Google AI Studio API key.
        *   `thingspeakAPIKey`: Your ThingSpeak Channel API Read Key.
        *   `thingspeakChannelID`: Your ThingSpeak Channel ID.
    5.  **Important:** The `APIKeys.swift` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to ensure your private keys are not committed to version control. Do not remove it from `.gitignore`.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MaaKosh.git # Replace with the actual repo URL
    cd MaaKosh
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Xcode:**
    *   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `MaaKosh.xcodeproj` file.
    ```bash
    open MaaKosh.xcodeproj
    ```
3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   If you want to use features like Authentication and Firestore, you'll need to set up a Firebase project:
        1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
        2.  Create a new project (or use an existing one).
        3.  Add an iOS app to your project with the bundle identifier found in Xcode (usually under Target > General).
        4.  Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
        5.  Place this file into the `MaaKosh/` directory in Xcode, ensuring it's included in the `MaaKosh` target.
4.  **Install Dependencies (Swift Package Manager):**
    *   Xcode should automatically resolve and fetch packages managed by Swift Package Manager. You can check the status in the "Package Dependencies" section of the project navigator or trigger a resolution via `File > Packages > Resolve Package Versions`.
5.  **Select a Simulator or Device:**
    *   Choose a target simulator or a connected physical device in Xcode.
6.  **Build and Run:**
    *   Click the "Play" button (or `Cmd+R`) in Xcode to build and run the application.

### Important Notes

*   **Functionality without Firebase:** Some features, particularly those related to AI and data persistence (like cycle tracking history, user profiles), will require a working Firebase setup. The app might run without it, but these features will likely be disabled or non-functional.
*   **API Keys Configuration:** Ensure you have configured your API keys in `MaaKosh/Core/APIKeys.swift` as described in the Prerequisites section for AI features and neonatal vitals monitoring to function correctly.
