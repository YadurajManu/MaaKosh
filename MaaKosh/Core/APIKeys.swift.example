IMPORTANT:
1. RENAME THIS FILE to `APIKeys.swift` (remove .example).
2. ENSURE `APIKeys.swift` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your actual keys.
3. REPLACE the placeholder values below with your actual API keys and channel ID.

This file provides a centralized place to store your API keys.
The actual `APIKeys.swift` file (once you rename this one and add your keys) should NOT be committed to version control.
